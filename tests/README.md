# Docker Compose Validation Tests

This directory contains tests to validate the Docker Compose files generated by this application.

## Tests Overview

The tests perform the following validations:

1. **Individual Service Validation**: Tests each service individually to ensure the Docker Compose configuration for each service is valid.
2. **Combined Services Validation**: Tests all services together to ensure they work properly when combined in a single Docker Compose file.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you need Docker installed on your system. The recommended way to run the tests is with Bun:

```bash
bun run tests/validate-compose.test.ts
```

You can also use the npm/pnpm script:

```bash
pnpm test:compose
```

or

```bash
npm run test:compose
```

## Test Requirements

- Docker must be installed and running on your system
- Docker Compose V2 must be available (comes with Docker Desktop or can be installed separately)
- Bun for running the tests (provides much faster execution than ts-node)

## Test Results

The test will output:
- A list of each service being tested
- A summary of successful and failed tests
- Details of any services that failed validation

## What's Being Tested

The tests:
1. Generate a Docker Compose file with the service(s) configuration
2. Create an environment file with default settings
3. Run `docker compose config` to validate the syntax and structure

This ensures that the Docker Compose files generated by the application are valid and can be used by users.
